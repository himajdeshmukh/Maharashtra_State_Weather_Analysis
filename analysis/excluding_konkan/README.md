## Analysis – Maharashtra Excluding Konkan

This module performs the same statistical analysis as the all-region
pipeline, but excludes Konkan districts.

### Rationale
Konkan’s coastal climate significantly differs from the rest of
Maharashtra and can mask inland climatic trends.

### Scope
- Konkan districts excluded
- Focus on Vidarbha, Marathwada, Western and North Maharashtra

### Outputs
- Comparative tables
- Inland-region summaries
- Inputs for alternative visualizations

### Notes
- Enables controlled climatic comparison
- No plotting is performed here
